# Ashveil Concept Overview

## Core Idea
Ashveil turns real-world 360° livestreams into dynamic, AI-reactive game environments. Chat participants or data feeds (via API) manipulate the world in real time—turning viewers into players.

## Vision
- Merge live video with interactive AI systems.
- Turn Twitch viewers into environmental game masters.
- Build the foundation for a new genre: live AI-driven narrative games.

## Features
- 360° video stream mapped to a virtual sphere
- Twitch chat API integration
- AI engine triggers in response to input (e.g. Stable Diffusion, ComfyUI, NVIDIA Broadcast SDK)
- Procedural FX generation (weather, lighting, events)
