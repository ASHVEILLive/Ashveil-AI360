# Ashveil: AI-Controlled 360Â° Interactive Game Worlds

Created by: **Ashley Gray**

Ashveil is a real-time interactive system that transforms 360Â° live video environments into immersive game worlds, controlled by Twitch chat or other APIs. The concept merges AI, live-streaming culture, and procedural scene generation into a new kind of digital entertainment.

## ðŸ§  Concept

Users influence the world via Twitch commands (`!storm`, `!spawn`, `!darken`, etc). The AI adapts in real-time, altering the environment or story dynamically.
