# Ashveil: Real-Time Interactive AI Worlds Powered by 360° Live Video

## 💡 Executive Summary

Ashveil is a revolutionary entertainment platform that transforms 360° live video streams into real-time, AI-reactive virtual worlds. Viewers on Twitch or other platforms can interact directly with the environment, triggering in-world events, weather changes, mood shifts, and more — turning passive viewership into interactive gameplay.

This project merges AI generation, live streaming, and immersive spatial video into a unified experience — where the audience literally shapes the world as it happens.

## 🔧 The Core Idea

Imagine walking through a real forest on stream. Someone types `!storm` in Twitch chat — and the scene begins to darken, the wind howls, and thunder rolls in. The world changes — not through cheap overlays, but through AI-driven transformation that mirrors the emotion of the crowd.

Ashveil is a modular system that overlays real-time AI models on 360° livestreams, transforming them into surreal, narrative-rich, interactive experiences.

## 🧠 How It Works

**Inputs:**
- 360° Live Camera Feed (e.g., Insta360, Ricoh Theta)
- Twitch Chat Commands (`!spawn`, `!darken`, etc)
- Optional: JSON/WebSocket API inputs

**Engine:**
- Live scene-to-AI overlay pipeline
- AI model triggers (Stable Diffusion, LLMs, etc.)
- Real-time processing of user interaction

**Outputs:**
- Live visual stream (Twitch, YouTube, etc.)
- Optional Unity or Unreal rendering integration
- Narrative and audio event scripting

---

## 🧩 Proposed Technology Stack

- **Live Video**: Insta360 RTMP, OBS, Ricoh, or YouTube Live input
- **AI Engine**: Stable Diffusion, ComfyUI, NVIDIA Broadcast SDK
- **Interaction Layer**: Twitch IRC API, PubSub for chat parsing
- **Rendering Layer**: Unity/Unreal optional for enhanced versions
- **Command Processing**: OpenAI/GPT for natural language -> actions
- **Middleware**: Python/Node.js for pipeline logic

---

## 🎮 Use Cases

- **Twitch AI Game Shows** — The chat controls a surreal narrative in real time
- **IRL Stream Evolution** — A walk through the city morphs into fantasy landscapes
- **Educational Journeys** — Turn historical walkthroughs into cinematic adventures
- **Live Concerts & Events** — Audience triggers pyrotechnics, visual FX, mood shifts
